echo "First Name: "
read FirstName
echo "Lastname: "
read LastName

read email
echo "username: "
read username



# Step 2 : adduser #######################################################################################

# Did adduser work? what to do if there is an error?
# Gives exit status 1 if adduser failed or generated error
#	< insert If statement here to handle adduser errors >
